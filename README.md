### Overview
The goal for this mini project is to further explore SpotipyAPI, this time applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for sentiment analysis of lyrics in Canada's Spotify generated hits playlist. The chosen playlist is "Hot Hits Canada", a playlist that contains 75 of the most played tracks in the country on the app.
